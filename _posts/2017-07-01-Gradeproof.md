# What is Gradeproof
GradeProof is a proofreading service that is more than just a spelling and grammar checker. It offers intelligent rephrasing suggestions to not only correct your writing, but to refine your phrasing and make it eloquent.

## About the Gradeproof Project
The aim of the project was to access informative data about the users are interaction within the Gradeproof service. The Gradeproof project needed ways of quickly visualising key metrics in the data and querying metrics programmatically for the client through an API and a web application dashboard. For 12 weeks, the project involved the team members and I to build these products in order to meet the clients requirements. We utilized python, javascript and AWS services, utilizing frameworks and libraries to build the product.
