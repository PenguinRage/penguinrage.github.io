## Intro
This is a personal site that acts as front page for my Git repository. The site offers a direct link to my repositories and my contact email address. The site
also includes:

* My PGP public key for encryption purposes
* Previous projects
* IT relevant posts

## About Me
I like long walks on the beach, feeding penguins, graph theory and well written code. I initially got into programming living in Japan whilst having an interest in language linguistics.
Since returning, I have completed a Bachelor in Computer Science and spent the next 3-4 years working as a Software Engineer. I have worked with various programming languages, cloud services and CI/CD tools.

Fun Facts:
 * I was born 5 days in from one of the worst market crashes in modern economics.
 * I survived an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 which created a tsunami that flooded Fukashima Nuclear reactors. 
 * Currently growing various carnivorous plants in an automated greenhouse.
 * Btw did I mention I use Arch Linux?
